Known Bugs List
* This list contains bugs in the latest version

- windows can draw outside their bounds
	* The part with text should be handled like this, i think: drawTextAtPos should return a texture/surface and not render directly.
	  Then inside the window we can either increase the window size according to the texture/surface size or copy only the part of the 
	  texture/surface to the renderer that is inside the window bounds.
- for some reason the text rendering currently looks shit (the 't's seem to be aligned incorrectly). Maybe this is a font/size problem? There are also differen font (render) qualities in SDL?



Task List
* This list will contain all tasks that still need to be completed.

- change mouse cursor (e.g. when hovering text input controls or when resizing/moving a window) via SDL_CreateSystemCursor
- implement pack function that reduces a window to its minimal required size (to still fit all children)
- finish radio button control
- add grouping window (GroupBox) for radio buttons and other controls
- implement slider control
- add scroll bars
- add timed events and redraws for animations
- maybe implement test renderer to unit test rendering stuff
- make sure controls are always positioned (and drawn) inside their parent window
- window id generation/assignment should account for user defined IDs and IDs that are reused
- adjust window size automatically to drawn content like text for buttons, checkboxes, text labels
- finish reference implementation of simple calculator
- evaluate not using global functions but package everything into a Gui top-level object
- implement renderer interface to enable bindings to renderers other than SDL
- implement window children positioning layouts (Flow layout, border layout, etc.)



Low priority:
- (optional) add canvas control
- (optional) add register control
- (optional) add combo-box (drop-down list) control
- (optional) add customizable menus and menu bars
- implement moving of windows (drag & drop), this also moves all controls in a window
- add functionality to (minimize/)maximize windows
- add title bar buttons for (minimizing/)maximizing



... and more
